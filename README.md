## Overview

Households have electricity needs that can be met by purchasing electricity from a provider or generating it using solar panels. In this project, the user has installed solar panels on their roof, generating electricity from sunlight. Currently, the solar-generated electricity is used immediately in their house, reducing electricity costs. The user is considering purchasing a battery to store excess solar-generated electricity. The battery would discharge energy when solar power isnâ€™t sufficient. Weâ€™ll analyze the potential savings in electricity costs from installing the battery, considering different scenarios of electricity price increases. Calculations will include extra electricity from the solar panel and battery combination, implied dollar savings, NPV, and IRR.

## Data Source

The user provides their hourly data for 2020 including the following information:

1. Date and Hour: Timestamps representing each hour of the year.
2. Solar Electricity Generated (kWh): The amount of electricity generated by the solar panels during that hour.
3. Electricity Used (kWh): The electricity consumed during the same hour.

This data will be crucial for our analysis. Feel free to provide the specific data, and weâ€™ll proceed with the calculations! ðŸ“Š

## Tools

1. Jupyter notebook - for cleaning, analysis and documentation [Guidance to installation](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html)
2. Python. [Install](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3123/)

The following Libraries will be essential;
```Python
import numpy_financial as npf     # Financial calculations eg calculation of IRR
import pandas as pd    # Data manipulation 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Data visualization 
import seaborn as stl  # Reading data (Excel)
```

If the above Libraries are not yet installed,you can follow the following steps:
1. Open you CMD prompt
2. Copy and paste each of the following lines:

```cmd
pip install numpy_finacial, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn
```

This will get your python environment ready for analysis.

## Data Cleaning 

This phase includes:
1. Finding and correcting missing values
2. Inspection of duplicates 
3. Deletion of negative values
4. Inspection of outliers and correcting them.

## Data Analysis

### Battery Consideration

The user is considering purchasing a battery to store excess solar-generated electricity. The battery would discharge energy during hours when solar power isnâ€™t sufficient. Electricity, including solar, battery-stored, and purchased, is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh). The specific battery under consideration costs $7,000, has a 20-year lifetime, and can store up to 12.5 kWh.

### Electricity Pricing

Starting from 1 January 2022, the user pays $0.17 per kWh for electricity from their provider. According to a government report, electricity prices increase annually by 4%. However, the user believes that climate change will lead to faster price increases, estimating an additional 0.25% p.a.

### Data and Analysis

The user has provided solar electricity generation and usage data for 2020 (hourly increments). Our analysis will focus on calculating the extra electricity generated by the solar panel and battery combination compared to using only solar panels. Additionally, weâ€™ll estimate the implied dollar savings in electricity costs resulting from installing the battery.

### Scenarios to Analyze

1. Scenario 1: Assuming electricity prices increase as expected (4% p.a.).

2. Scenario 2: Considering the userâ€™s estimated price increases (starting at 4% p.a. and rising by 0.25% p.a.).

### Calculations

Weâ€™ll perform the following calculations:

- Extra electricity (in kWh) from the solar panel + battery combination.
- Implied dollar savings resulting from battery installation.
- NPV (Net Present Value) of the battery investment using a discount rate of 6% p.a.
- IRR (Internal Rate of Return) for both scenarios.
Remember, the IRR represents the discount rate where NPV equals the initial cost.

## Results

The NPV for future projections in both scenarios had negative values suggesting that investing in a solar battery would be unworthy. The IRR for both scenarios had a low negative value hence the profitability on the investment would be less desirable. The table below shows the NPV and IRR of the projected years

## Conclusions

By calculating the NPV and IRR of investment in installation of a solar battery, the project was deduced to be unworthy and not desirable.
