## Overview

Households have electricity needs that can be met by purchasing electricity from a provider or generating it using solar panels. In this project, the user has installed solar panels on their roof, generating electricity from sunlight. Currently, the solar-generated electricity is used immediately in their house, reducing electricity costs. The user is considering purchasing a battery to store excess solar-generated electricity. The battery would discharge energy when solar power isnâ€™t sufficient. Weâ€™ll analyze the potential savings in electricity costs from installing the battery, considering different scenarios of electricity price increases. Calculations will include extra electricity from the solar panel and battery combination, implied dollar savings, NPV, and IRR.

## Data Source

The user provides their hourly data for 2020 including the following information:

1. Date and Hour: Timestamps representing each hour of the year.
2. Solar Electricity Generated (kWh): The amount of electricity generated by the solar panels during that hour.
3. Electricity Used (kWh): The electricity consumed during the same hour.

This data will be crucial for our analysis. Feel free to provide the specific data, and weâ€™ll proceed with the calculations! ðŸ“Š

## Tools

- Python notebook - for cleaning, analysis and documentation
The following Libraries will be essential;
```Python
import numpy as np     # Mathematical calculations 
import pandas as pd    # Data manipulation 
import matplotlib as plt # Data visualization 
import seaborn as stl  # Reading data (Excel)
```

If the above Libraries are not yet installed,you can follow the following steps:
1. Open you CMD prompt
2. Copy and paste each of the following lines:

```cmd
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib 
pip install seaborn
```

This will get your python environment ready for analysis.

## Data Cleaning 

This phase includes:
1. Finding and correcting missing values
2. Inspection of duplicates 
3. Deletion of negative values
4. Inspection of outliers and correcting them.
